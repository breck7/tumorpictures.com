<h1 class="scrollTitleComponent"><a href="readme.html">WorldWideTypes</a></h1>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">This folder contains the start of a project to build a grammar of world wide types. The idea is to have a grammar containing the most common types used in the world, that anyone can use and contribute back to.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">Currently it supports type declarations and interfaces.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">It will compile to TypeScript at first, and other languages later.</p>
